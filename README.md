<h2>Repository Info</h2>
This repo is intended to be used as a mashup repository that will contain all of the steps that I'm going to be taking to building out an
official final product. Any mock-up ideas that I undertake will be thrown into their own project folder with which I expect to take those
prototypes and slot them into what I intend to be my final product. 

As I'm sure you can guess these projects are built out on the Godot Engine and will most likely all be built out using GDScript. The Godot
Engine is capable of handling GDScript, C#, and C++ so it's possible that I will end up switching over to other languages throughout
development.

<h2>Pawns</h2>
Pawns is an idea that I've been playing around with in my head for a long time now. I have always been a huge fan of pixel art based games,
as well as sandbox-decision based games. And thats exactly what I intend for Pawns to be. 

This idea takes heavy inspiration from games like Bastion and Hyper Light Drifter, however I intend for it to be much more of an open world
experience. 
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Mapping Setup</h4>
    The world of Pawns is envisioned to consist of four seperate biomes that will be rendered out as seperate regions. The biomes that make
    up the world will be the forest lands, swamp lands, mountain lands, and desert lands. Each zone will consist of their own series of major
    and minor cities, traveling salesmen, military outposts and castles, and dungeons. The actual structure of the zones will be entirely
    pre-built and consistent over each playthrough, however, the contents of the locations will vary during play and will generate differently
    for each play through as well.
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Major cities</h5>
        These cities will exist inside of each zone and will require a reload upon entering, meaning they will not be rendered until you actually
        enter their walls. They will be broken up into districts:
         <ul>
          <li>Merchant</li>
          The player will be able to stock up on curatives and purchase weapons and armor here
          <li>Hospitality</li>
          The player will be able to take rest at the inns and spend some time in the taverns here
          <li>Regal</li>
          The player will be able to receive quests from the people here, and find religious attonement here as well
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li><h5>Minor Cities</h5>
        These cities will dot the country side of each zone, and thus will not consist of a reload upon entering. They will exist as free 
        standing locations that will mostly just exist as a place for our player to rest or spend time at a tavern. These towns merchants
        may have a low stock of curatives, but will almost never sell weapons or armour.
       </li>
       <li><h5>Traveling Merchants</h5>
        These people will wander the roads of each zone and will have a low stock of curatives or other consumables, and may rarely have
        some rare or high quality weapons or armour. Some may even be from different zones and offer goods from the corresponding zone they
        travel from.
       </li>
       <li><h5>Military Outposts or Castles</h5>
        These locations will exists over looking cities, they will have various inhabitants and may even end up being completely empty. These
        locations, as well as all others, will have the possibility of changing based on the decisions the player makes, and will be the 
        most common changing locations.
       </li>
       <li><h5>Dungeons</h5>
        Dungeons will be extremely dangerous locations, and the focal point for the lore of our story. The dungeons will be inhabitated by people
        who are attempting to ressurrect the old gods. Each zone will have four dungeons, one for each of our old gods, and one dungeons in
        each zone will have been succesful. Meaning that they will have a large boss fight at the end of the dungeon in which the player will
        fight one of the old gods. Each dungeon will have enemy types that are based around the old god that they are attempting to bring back.
